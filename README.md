# Housing-Prices
Prediction of Housing Prices
In this project I am trying to predict prices of Houses with Dataset from Kaggle.


I used Linear Regression and Linear Regression with Deep Learning to compare two methods and evaluated them with r squared.

This project is made with Python Libraries: Keras, Matplotlib, Pandas and Sklearn.
